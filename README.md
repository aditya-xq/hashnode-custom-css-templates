- Copy paste the css styling for home, articles, and pages.
- Default hashnode classes and ids are taken care off.
- Custom html ids are added for more flexibility. These must be added in html tags in markdown while writing the blog posts/pages. (Example: custom-hr, custom-link)

To change color scheme, you can simply change the CSS variables. You may use this template css and modify on top of this to speed up your styling.

You can use the following online tools to generate your own color palatte:
